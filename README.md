# Minigame-Engine
A minigame engine written with Java using the Velocity API. I use Jedis to communicate between my Spigot plugin and this plugin. An example of such a plugin is my [Hunt-or-be-hunted](https://github.com/Ja90n/Hunt-or-be-hunted) minigame. It supports multiple maps and it has a party system.
